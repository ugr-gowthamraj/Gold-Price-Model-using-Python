# Simple-Gold-Price-Statistical-Model-using-Python
Written the python code to build a simple linear regression model without using any libraries. Used Feb month gold price (USD per Oz) for formulating the line equation. I have attached the dataset and python file in this repository. Assumed that current price is a function of the last closing price.
